# QOSF-2024-Cohort9-Screening_tasks
This repository contains my submission for the screening round of the QOSF cohort 9 Screening Round problems, specifically problem 3. We wish to solve the 4 problems presented in this year's QOSF submission challenges for selection. Despite not getting selected for the program for a very miniscule and silly mistake from my side, I think it is important to keep track of important events: setbacks and successes in life to see how far one has come. 

This is exactly why, I thought of posting the solutions for the problem I solved as well as the other 3 problems as well. These are beginner level quantum problems themselves and hence present an opportunity to help me to brush up my programming and algorithmic thinking skills.
